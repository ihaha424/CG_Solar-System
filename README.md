<h3>Interative 3D Graphic Educational Source </h3>

CG-Solar System is project as an graphical-dynamic application source to modify science education with in-class static lecture about Solar System.  Since there are few web sites with similar purpose available in English but none of them exists in Korean, our team targeted Korean students. We expect CG_Solar-System help students understand lectures from Solar System (such as Kepler's Law of Planet) in entaining way.
